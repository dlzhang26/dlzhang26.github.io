    "text": "This is an example of a Quarto website. All the Quarto markdown features we learned for formatting text, adding headings and subheadings, adding code and output, adding labels and captions and whatnot work as usual.\n\n\nThe website project folder/repo will contain the following files, at a minimum:\n\n_quarto.yml: A configuration file that controls the YAML content, similar to what we typically see at the top of our qmd files.\nUse this file to add or remove additional subpages, change the overall website title, customize the navigation bar contents and layout, change the website theme, and set any other default formatting options such as code chunk options.\nindex.qmd: This is the landing page of your website. This file must be called index.qmd and must be located in the root directory of the project.\nUse this page, at a minimum, to introduce your project. From there you can either fully include the contents of the project or use additional qmd files to create subpages of your website (perhaps explaining the structure of the website to the user on this landing page).\nbib folder: Contains the bibliography file, which you should edit to include your resources, and a .csl file that tells Quarto how to format in-text citations and the bibliography list according to the American Statistical Association citation style.\ndocs folder: The rendered content of the website will be located here.\nstyles.css: This file is currently empty, but if you want to modify or replace the default theme, do so here using CSS. Students in the past have used custom color palettes or custom fonts, for example.\nAdditional qmd files: If you want to add subpages with their own content, create new qmd files in your root directory to do so, being sure to include them in the list of contents in your _quarto.yml file.\n\n\n\nSimilar to the Shiny project, you will need to organize your wrangling scripts and data. You may also have other images or figures saved for displaying in your blog that will also need to be organized. Here are recommendations for organization.\n\nscripts: Store wrangling scripts in their own folder\ndata: Store datasets in their own folder, being sure to separate raw data from clean/processed data. You can do this in one of two ways: two separate data folders in the root directory (e.g., raw-data and data) or two subfolders of a single data folder (subfolders called, for example, raw, processed).\nimages: Organize saved images or figures together in their own folder. Make sure you keep track of the source of the images or figures and credit the sources in some way in your page (include source in caption and/or link image to source)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit contents of any files. Each new qmd file is a self-contained environment, so you will need to load any necessary packages and datasets for rendering that particular file at the top of that file.\nGo to the Build tab of RStudio (in the same pane as Environment, History, etc.), and click Render Website.\nCommit changes to website and push to publish those changes.\n\nYou can also render individual qmd files one at a time as usual (e.g., using Command + Shift + K or clicking the Render button at the top of the qmd file) to interactively see how a single page changes. However, in order for those changes to display correctly on your published website, you must render the full website first by going to the Build tab and clicking Render Website before committing and pushing the updates."

Appropriately cross-referencing tables and figures is required for this project.\nQuarto additionally provides similar syntax for creating labels for and cross-referencing equations, creating labels for and cross-referencing sections, and using code chunk options of the form lst-label: lst-your-listing-label and lst-cap: Code chunk caption to be able to cross-reference displayed code chunks (or “listings”) using the syntax @lst-your-listing-label within the text. These are not required for this project but are good practice."

    "section": "Creating the bibliography",
    "text": "Creating the bibliography\nOne of the new challenges of Quarto, relative to a Word or Google doc, is learning how to build a bibliography and use the specified citation keys to write in-text citations.\nAll items you plan to cite should be added to the library.bib bibliography file using standard bibtex syntax for each entry. If the resource you are using doesn’t already provide a way to generate a bibtex entry, I recommend using zoterobib to generate the appropriate syntax (must change the Bibliography style to “BibTeX generic citation style”). The syntax examples shown below capture the range of entries you are most likely to use. These entries are currently in library.bib, but you should delete and replace the contents of library.bib with your own citation entries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe examples below are nicely formatted so you can read and follow the patterns, but formatting and order of the library.bib file doesn’t actually matter and will not be assessed.

As a reminder, though you can use markdown syntax to display or embed images, I would strongly recommend instead using knitr’s include_graphics() functions within code chunks. This makes it easier to modify figures, add captions and links, and visually find the code for figures quickly if you need to modify something about the output.\n\n\nShow the code\ninclude_graphics(\"https://i.giphy.com/H7ZrrA9V2pd3Tehdds.webp\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage courtesy of giphy.com\n\n\n\n\nEither approach will take either a filepath to a stored file or a URL to to an image or gif. Width can be specified as a percentage of the width of the page (0% to 100%; my preferred approach) or as a fixed number of units (e.g. 400px, 3in, 10cm).\nI can’t imagine a scenario where students should or would include videos within their blog, but Quarto provides guidance on embedding videos, as well."
